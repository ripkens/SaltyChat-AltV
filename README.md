- Update the "OnResourceStart" function in "VoiceManager.cs" to reflect your Teamspeak settings
 
 ```
this.ServerUniqueIdentifier = "";
this.MinimumPluginVersion = "x.x.x";
this.SoundPack = "default";
this.IngameChannel = IngameChannel = "x";
this.IngameChannelPassword = IngameChannelPassword = "1234";
 ```
 
- add ```alt.emitClient(player, "SaltyChat_OnConnected");``` and  ```alt.emit("PlayerLoggedIn", player);``` to your player Spawn function to move the player into the Teamspeak-Channel for Ingame-Voice
 
- The Server will Emit "client::updateVoiceRange" to the Player on VoiceRange change, you can react to it in your HUD for example.
